# Requirements
# System and Integration requirements:
The program shall be written in standard C, as compiled by the GNU C compiler. The program shall use only standard C library 
functions. The program shall be usable on any system which supports the compiler, and shall not require any particular 
hardware or software.System must have 4GB or above ram.
# Interface requirements:
There are no existing external data bases or files that will be needed by this program and human interface.
# Module requirements:
The input value must be finite and real to perform unit conversion operations. If the value is out the above category the
application should display the relevant error helping the user to resolve the erroneous situation.
# Functional requirements:
The application should convert a value given in form of unit to required form of unit.
# Non-functional requirements:
 Non-functional requirements would be a split second to deliver the answer, any slower, the application would be rejected. 
The application must be scalable i.e., it would work with large numbers.

# 4W's and 1'H
# Who:
This project can be used by school or collecge students.
# What:
It converts measured quantity in one unit for.
# When:
When people want to know the given value in another form of value.
# Where:
It can be implemented in caluculators.
# How:
The system will help in converting quantity in one form of unit to another form of unit without changing their original value.
